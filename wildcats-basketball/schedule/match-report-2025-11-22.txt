## Wildcats vs Tigers

**Date:** November 22, 2025
**Final:** Wildcats 22, Tigers 0
**Halves:** 2 x 20 minutes

### First Half

(0:00 to 20:00, mapped from Q1 0:00 to 23:13)

The Wildcats opened the afternoon with an immediate defensive surge. Felicity (#2) controlled the glass from the opening minute, hauling in rebounds around the **19:20** mark. Just seconds later, Emersyn (#25) jumped a pass for the first steal of the day and finished a fast break layup at roughly **19:15**, starting the scoring at 2–0.

The Tigers couldn't settle. Turnovers at **18:57**, **17:47**, and **16:47** fed into the Wildcats' transition game, and Emersyn repeatedly punished those mistakes. Around **17:30**, she picked another pass and finished her second layup, stretching the lead to 4–0.

Blake (#5) and Emma (#10) checked in midway through the half and immediately lifted the team's rebounding and defensive pressure. Blake grabbed boards around **13:20** and **12:10**, while Emma recorded three steals in under a minute as the clock approached **12:00**.

Winnie (#1) entered and changed the game's tempo. After a steal near **11:40**, she sprinted ahead in transition and finished a layup at roughly **12:30**, extending the lead to 6–0. She followed it with another rebound moments later.

Lucy, the Tigers' point guard, tried to initiate offense around the **9:00** mark, but Felicity swiped a pass at **11:27**, and Winnie added more steals in the next two-minute window. The pressure never let up.

Physical play picked up inside five minutes. Hazel (#3) drew a foul around **5:40**, and Samantha (#22) picked one up around **5:00** while fighting through contact. Madison (#00) entered and added defensive energy as well, drawing a foul with just over **3 minutes** left in the half.

The Wildcats closed strong. Near **2:00** left, Winnie scored again off a steal, pushing it to 8–0. Felicity added a put-back around **1:30** to make it 10–0. As the half wound down, Emersyn scored in traffic at around **1:50**, and the Wildcats entered halftime ahead **12–0**, with one additional bucket in the log removed for a violation.

Lucy, the Tigers guard, exited briefly with a hand injury in the half's final moments, another result of the Wildcats' suffocating pressure.

### Second Half

(20:00 to 40:00, mapped from Q2 23:13 to 43:47)

The second half opened with Hazel immediately setting the tone again, grabbing a steal around **19:00**. Blake continued to dominate the boards, collecting rebounds near **18:30**, and though a turnover followed, the defensive intensity stayed high.

Madison picked up another foul early in the half while contesting a play and later turned the ball over trying to push through traffic. Despite that, she remained locked in defensively and would later add a late steal.

A strong rebounding stretch came around **16:00**: Hazel pulled down a rebound, Teagan (#15) secured another, and Samantha added one more. The Tigers struggled to even get second looks for several possessions in a row.

Around **14:15**, Emersyn broke loose again, turning a steal into a layup to push the lead to 14–0. She then stacked up rebounds and steals in the next ninety seconds. Winnie forced a jump ball around **13:30**, and Emma added another rebound. Felicity and Emersyn continued dominating the boards around **12:20** to **11:40**.

Between **10:00** and **7:00**, the Wildcats completely shut the Tigers down. Blake, Winnie, Samantha, and Hazel rebounded everything, and Hazel delivered one of the top highlights of the game by blocking a Tigers shot cleanly at **8:50**. Samantha added a steal around **6:30**, continuing the defensive onslaught.

Offensively, the Wildcats closed the game with steady contributions. Felicity finished another put-back with **6:15** left to make it 16–0. Blake followed with a strong basket off her own rebound around **4:20**, pushing the lead to 18–0.

In the final three minutes, Madison ripped a steal at **2:30**, slamming the door completely. Emersyn added one last layup inside the closing minute, bringing the final to **22–0**.
