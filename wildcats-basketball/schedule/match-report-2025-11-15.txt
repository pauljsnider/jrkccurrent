Final Score: 10-10 (Tie after OT)

The Wildcats played their most dramatic game of the season on November 15, battling the All Stars to a 10 to 10 tie in a game that needed overtime and about a million deep breaths from the crowd. With two 20 minute halves and a short 2 minute overtime, it felt like a full playoff thriller for these 4th graders.

### First Half – Finding Their Footing

From the opening tip, the game had a playoff feel. The All Stars struck first, slipping in an early layup to go up 2 to 0 in the first few minutes while the Wildcats were still settling in.

Madison (#00) set the tone defensively right away. She jumped passing lanes, grabbing an early steal and pushing the ball up the court. A couple of those fast breaks turned into turnovers, but they were the kind that showed her confidence and aggression. Teagan (#15) helped free her teammates with solid screens, and Blake (#5) poked the ball loose for one of her early steals, getting the Wildcats bench and parents fired up.

The Wildcats needed someone to steady things, and that is when Felicity (#2) started to go to work. Around the middle of the half, she crashed the glass for a defensive rebound, then a few possessions later found herself open and calmly knocked down the Wildcats first basket of the game to tie it at 2 to 2. Her rebounding all night was huge; every time a shot went up, it felt like she was under it.

The All Stars answered with another bucket from their hot hand to make it 4 to 2. The Wildcats could have folded, but they did the opposite. Hazel (#3) and Kayla (#4) started cleaning up missed shots, each pulling down key rebounds to stop second chances. Samantha (#22) picked up a foul battling on defense, showing she was not afraid to mix it up. Winnie (#1) handled the ball against pressure, drawing contact and picking up a couple of fouls against the All Stars as she tried to drive and make the right pass.

With a couple of minutes left in the half, Emersyn (#25) changed the momentum. After a rebound on one end and a steal near midcourt, she turned on the jets, took it strong to the basket, and scored to tie the game at 4 to 4. She added another rebound late in the half to lock things down, and the teams headed to halftime all square, 4 to 4.

### Second Half – Comeback Kids

The second half started with a punch from the All Stars. In the first few minutes after the break they hit back to back shots, stretching the lead to 8 to 4. The Wildcats were suddenly down by four and needed an answer.

They found it on the defensive end. Teagan pulled down a tough rebound in traffic. Hazel grabbed multiple boards and helped push the ball out to the guards. Felicity continued to gobble up rebounds, stacking them one after another. The defensive intensity picked up, and the All Stars had to work for every look.

Midway through the half, the hard work paid off. After another stretch of tough defense and a rebound by Hazel, the Wildcats got the ball to Emersyn. She attacked the lane again and scored to cut the deficit to 8 to 6. You could feel the energy swing to the Wildcats side of the gym.

A few minutes later, with time starting to matter, Blake came up with one of the plays of the game. After securing a rebound, she pushed the ball up the court, found a lane, and finished her shot to tie it at 8 to 8. Her combination of steals, hustle, and that clutch basket was a huge spark.

The All Stars refused to go away, though. Their top scorer answered once more, putting them ahead 10 to 8 with just a few minutes to go. That is when the Wildcats defense completely locked in. Madison fought for another rebound and a steal. Emma (#10) grabbed a rebound of her own, then got a steal on the next possession, staying aggressive even after picking up an offensive foul on an earlier drive.

With a little under two minutes left, the Wildcats got the ball back off another defensive stand. They worked it around, and once again it was Emersyn who delivered. She found a seam, attacked the rim, and scored her third basket of the day to tie the game at 10 to 10. On the next trip, she followed it with a steal, and Hazel added another steal of her own, making sure the All Stars did not get an easy game winner. Regulation ended with the crowd on their feet and the score still tied.

### Overtime – Heart and Hustle

The short overtime period felt like a mini championship. Every possession mattered.

In OT, the Wildcats leaned on their trademark effort. Felicity grabbed another clutch rebound, and later added a steal that stopped a promising All Stars possession. Winnie continued to handle the ball under pressure, even with the All Stars swiping at everything. She did turn it over once in the extra period, but she kept coming back for the inbounds and never shied away from the moment.

Kayla and Teagan battled for position on defense, making sure the All Stars had to shoot over hands. Madison stayed active in the passing lanes, and while the scoreboard did not change, the Wildcats defense held firm.

The All Stars picked up a couple of fouls as they tried to drive, but the Wildcats would not let them get a clean look at the rim. When the final buzzer sounded at the end of overtime, it was still tied 10 to 10. No winner on the scoreboard, but both teams walked away knowing they had just played an absolute classic.
